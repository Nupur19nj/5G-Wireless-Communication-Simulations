## Project Overview

The **5G Wireless Communication Simulations** project is designed to help users understand various facets of 5G technologies by simulating real-world scenarios. These simulations can help students, engineers, and researchers to grasp the concepts of:
- Network slicing
- mmWave propagation
- Beamforming algorithms
- MCS and their effects on signal performance (BER & SNR)

By running these simulations, users can visualize key metrics like throughput, latency, and packet loss for different types of services (eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC).

## Key Features

- **Network Slicing Performance Simulation:** Simulates different 5G network slices, visualizing throughput, latency, and packet loss.
- **mmWave Propagation Simulation:** Simulates how mmWave signals propagate in various environments (urban, indoor), visualizing path loss and the impact of different path loss models.
- **Beamforming Algorithms Simulation:** Simulates beamforming in 5G networks to understand signal optimization and coverage.
- **MCS Simulation (BER & SNR):** Simulates the impact of different modulation and coding schemes (MCS) on Bit Error Rate (BER) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).

## Simulation Modules

### Network Slicing Performance
This module allows you to simulate and visualize how different network slices (eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC) perform under varying traffic loads. It includes the following metrics:
- Throughput (Mbps)
- Latency (ms)
- Packet Loss (%)

Users can set the simulation duration and observe the performance of each slice over time.

### mmWave Propagation
The mmWave propagation simulation demonstrates how the signal attenuates over distance and how different environmental factors (urban or indoor) affect signal quality. Users can select:
- **Environment Type:** Urban or Indoor
- **Path Loss Model:** Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) or COST231 model
- **Frequency (GHz):** Range of 30 GHz to 300 GHz

The results include:
- Path loss vs. distance chart
- Heatmap of signal coverage in different environments

### Beamforming Algorithms
This module simulates beamforming techniques that are key to optimizing coverage and signal strength in 5G networks. The simulation results help in visualizing how different beamforming strategies affect network performance.

### MCS Simulation (BER & SNR)
This module simulates how different Modulation and Coding Schemes (MCS) impact Bit Error Rate (BER) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). It helps to understand the trade-offs between data rate and error performance.
